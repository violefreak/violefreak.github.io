Hi, there! <br>
So this is it. I am starting 2021 with my own website, which hopefully will be filled with a lot of fun Python projects in the future. Currently, I am still studying: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-datascience-bootcamp/"> Python: Data Science, Machine Learning & Neuronale Netze</a> - Vom Python-Anf√§nger zum gefragten Data-Science-Experten (inkl. Deep Learning): Der Komplettkurs by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jannisseemann">Jannis Seemann</a>.<br>
We will see how it goes, so far I am really enjoying myself. There are small quiz and tasks to solve, which I often modify to make them more challenging. However, it would be nice to know how to incorporate a GUI to my small programms. I guess that's my next challenge for the future :)<br>
Happy New Year, everyone!
