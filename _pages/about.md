Hi, thanks for stopping by. My name is Violetta Wacker and I am currently managing a STEM educational project for teens in northern Germany with 60 partners involved. However, I originally studied physics at the Univerity of Hamburg. Being a physics student in Hamburg it is almost inpossible not to fall for accelerator physics. And that's how I came to work at DESY. My studies at DESY allowed me to visit SLAC for a research stay, which was simply amazing.
